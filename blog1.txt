Basic Stress Management Techniques

Recognize Stressors
Identify the events, situations, or people who induce or increase stress. It may help if you keep a diary detailing your emotions over a span of weeks or months and mark out areas that have caused stress.

Rehearsing the Right Breathing Procedures
Take control of your anxieties. Practice this: Breathe in through your nose for a count of four; hold your breath for the same amount of time, and then breathe out through your mouth, simulating the action of gently forcing out air while feeling subdued.

Don’t be Sedentary
Participate in physical action every day, even if it only involves walking around the house or taking long strolls on the weekends. Physical workouts stimulate the release of endorphins, which can help in brightening your mood

Talk about it
Ask them if they would be kind enough to lend you their ears. Connecting simply involves the exchange of compelling and decisive words with close people.

Find the ‘Me’ time
Self-pampering doesn’t have to be restricted to just once a week, plan your schedule well in advance and reserve 10 minutes every day to treat yourself, relaxing will do wonders for the mind.
